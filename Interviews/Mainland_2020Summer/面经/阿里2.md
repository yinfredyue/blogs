空指针调用类型上的函数？

- static function
- non-static
    - With reference to member
    - WIthout reference to other member

TLDR: static function works. If `this` is not used for non-static, it's ok.



Difference between`std::map` and `std::unordered_map`

- `std::map`
    - Ordering: increasing order by default
    - Implemented using **self-balancing BST** like Red-black tree
    - Cannot have repeated key
    - search time: O(logN)
    - insertion time: O(logN) + rebalancing
    - deletion time: O(logN) + rebalancing
    - drawback: the tree could take much memory
- `std::unordered_map`
    - no ordering
    - implemented using **hash table**
    - search time: O(1) in average case, O(N) in worst case
    - insertion time: same as search time
    - deletion time: same as search time
    - drawback: overhead of hash table



判断一个类型有没有一个方法？（TODO: read the link)
