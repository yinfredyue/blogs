- There can be multiple routers between 2 networks, for performance and robustness.  
- Architectual perspective of network
    - Architectures are helpful for reasoning about complex systems. Layering is a basic abstraction that can be applied to many systems.
    - Protocol: a specification for an interface between 2 modules running on *different* machines, plus communication services implemented by the modules.
    - Protocol characteristics: 
        - Data format (header, body, etc)
        - Rules for exchanging information
        - Services implemented
    - Protocol interfaces
        - Service interface: interface between protocols in the same system
        - Peer interface: interface between the same layer on separate systems
    - Multiple protocols can exist on the same layer

- Internet layered architecture
    ```
    L5: Application -> define interactions with users
    L4: Transport   -> define logical channels between apps and the network
    L3: Network     -> define how packets move (routing + forwarding)
    L2: Link        -> define how hosts access physical layer
    L1: Physical    -> cabal and bit representations

                   Data unit    Protocols
    +------------+
    | Application| message      HTTP, FTP, Email, ...
    +------------+
    | Transport  | message          TCP, UDP
    +------------+      
    | Network    | packet               IP
    +------------+
    | Link       | frame        Ethernet, ...
    +------------+
    | Physical   | bit          Cabel
    +------------+
    ```
    Note: 
    1. routers only have 3 layers and switches only have 2 layers.
    2. The internet layered architecture with a single protocol at layer-3 is called an "hourglass design".
    
- Encapsulation & Decapsulation
    - Encapsulation: takes place at each layers as data moves down, adding headers.
    - Decapsulation: takes place at each layers as data moves up, removing headers.

- IP Service Model 
    The only service provided by the IP protocol is "**Best-effort, destination-based forwarding**".
