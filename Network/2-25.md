# Wireless LAN (WLAN)

- Difference between WLAN and Ethernet  
    - A node on an Ethernet receives every other node's transmissions, while a node in WLAN can only recieve within its range.
    - A node on an Ethernet can receive and send at the same time, while antennas in WLAN cannot, so collision detection in CSMA/CD using carrier-sense does not work for WLAN.

    - *exposed node problem*
