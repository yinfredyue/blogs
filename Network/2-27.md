## MAC for WiFi

Problem faced: hidden terminal problem + exposed terminal problem  
Solution: Carrier-sense, Multiple-access, with collision-avoidance (CSMA/CA).  

RTS-CTS (Request to send-Clear to send) Mechanism  
1. If the channel is busy, the sender waits (carrier-sense). When the channle is idle, sender will trasnmit a RTS, which includes the length of the frame
2. Receiver responds with a CTS, including the frame length, to inform nodes in the range how long they should be quiet. (This solves the hidden terminal problem.)

    Any host receiving an RST but not the corresponding CTS knows that it is in the range of the sender but not the range of the receiver, so it can send without causing interferance. (This addresses the exposed terminal problem.)

3. Receiver sends ACK frame on successful receipt.  

Collision can happen when 2 nodes want to send RTS at the same time, causing the RTS frames to collide with each other. The senders realize the collision when they do not receive the CTS frame after some time. In this case, the two nodes enter exponential backoff just like 802.11, except that the time value is the length to transmit a RTS frame.  

## Two flavors of WLAN
- WLAN with base stations 
Two classes of nodes: base station (a.k.a access-points) and client node. Base stations have high-bandwidth connection to the Internet, while client nodes are mobile and reply on the link to the base station for communications with other nodes.  

- Ad hoc network 
Nodes are equal peers, each capable for forwarding messages.  

In practice, ad hoc networks are not widely used and WLANs are implemented via access-points which manage connectivity of mobile nodes. In this case, mobile nodes associate with access-points using a simple packet exchange. After association, all subsequent communication goes through the access-points. 



# Layer 3: Network Layer

- Abilities at each layer
    - Layer 1: moving bits/frames
    - Layer 2: moving frames between hosts within a LAN
    - Layer 3: moving packets between networks

- Issues at layer 3  
    - Addressing  
    - Routing (establishing the forwarding table)  

- (Confusing) Terms
    - physical network v.s. logical network 
        A logical network consists of multiple physical network.  
    - network v.s. internet(work)

- Service model 
    Service model: the host-to-host service the protocol intends to provide.  
    IP: addressing + (best-effort) forwarding.

    - Best-effort forwarding 
        The packet could be lost, corrupted, misdelivered, unordered and no action would be taken: unreliable service.  

    - Packet format 
        ![](ip-packet-format.jpg)  
        `HLen`: length of header in words. 
        `Length`: length of packet (header + payload) in bytes. 
        `ident`&`Flags`&`Offset`: used for fragmentation and reassembly. 
        `TTL`: "Time-To-Leave", a hop count to avoid infinite forwarding. 
        
    The header takes 20 bytes/5 words.
    
- Fragmentation and Reassembly  
    - MTU 
        IP runs over a heterogeneous collection of networks and each network might have different MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit). Note that MTU is smaller than then largest packet size since the IP datagram needs to fit into the *payload* of the layer-2 frame.  

    - `Ident` & `Flags` & `Offset` 
        Fragmentation happens at a **router** when it receives a datagram that it wants to forward over a network with MTU smaller than the datagram. The fragments carry the same identifier in the `Ident` field, a `M` flag is set for all fragments except the last one and `Offset` is the byte position from the start divided by 8 (fragmentation can only happen on 8-byte boundary).   
    
    - fragment 
        Each fragment is a self-containied IP datagram (with complete header), independent of its counterparts. This makes it possible for fragmentation process to be repeated when further fragmenting is required.  

    - reassembly 
        IP reassembly is done at the receiving host and not at each router. If not all fragments arrive at the receiving host, the host gives up the reassembly process and discards any received fragments.  

    - Avoid fragmentation 
        IP reassembly is expensive and thus IP fragmentation is generally avoided. *Path MTU discovery* is used to find the smallest MTU on the path prior to sending.    
        - Idea 
        Sender sends a packet with "do not fragment" flag;  
        Any router that would have to fragment the packet would drop the packet and sends back a response; 
        Keeps halfing the packet size until finding the suitable one. 

- IPv4 
    An IPv4 address is 32-bit, organized via "dot notation" where dots are used to separate each 8-bit portaion of the address: `0.0.0.0` ~ `255.255.255.255`.  

    An IP address is divided into 2 parts: *network portion* and *host portion*.  

    For a router connecting multiple networks, it needs to have an address on each network, one for each interface. It is more precise to think of IP addresses as belonging to **interfaces** than to hosts.  

    - Reserved IP addresses 
        The lowest and highest value in host portition is reserved. For example, class C network allocates 8 bits for host portition. So number of hosts in a class-C network is 2^8 - 2 = 254.  

    - Private IP address 
        Network Address Translation (NAT). A host could be assigned a "private address" that is not globally unique, but is unique within some limited scope. As long as the host communicates only with other hosts in the same scope, a locally unique address is sufficient. If it wants to communicate with a host outside the scope, it does so via a NAT box, a device that is able to translate from the private address used by the host to some globally unique address assigned to the NAT box. Since it’s likely that a small subset of the hosts in the scope requires the services of the NAT box at any one time, the NAT box might be able to get by with a small pool of globally unique addresses, much smaller than the number of addresses that would be needed if every host in the scope had a globally unique address.  

    - How are hosts assigned IP addresses?
        - Statically
        - Dynamically using DHCP
            Dynamic Host Control Protocol, DHCP. If a host doesn't have an IP address assigned, it sends a request to `255.255.255.255`. The DHCP server would respond with an IP address via link-layer.

- IP forwarding  
    - Definition  
        - forwarding: taking packet on the input inteface and send out on the correct output interface  
        - routing: establishig the forwarding table  

    - So far, we have:
        - Each IP datagram contains destination IP address
        - Network portion of an IP address uniquely identifies a physical network  
        - Hosts and routers sharing the same network number are within the same physical network and can communicate directly using link-layer protocol (e.g., Ethernet, WLAN, etc)

        So the problem is how to move a packet from the source network to the destination network.
    
- Mechanism 
    When a router receives a packet, first examine whether the dst is in the same physical network (by checking network number with the network number of each of its interfaces). If yes, send via link-layer protocol. Otherwise, the packet needs to be forwarded to another router. The router chosen is called the *next hop* router and hopefully the next hop router is a reasonbly good choice. The forwarding table is a list of `<Network Num, Next Hop>` entires. Normally there's also a default router in case no match found in the forwarding table. For a host, it is perfectly fine for it to have a default router and an empty forwarding table.  
    
    - Algorithm  
        ```
        if (dst network num == network num of one of my interfaces) then
            deliver packet to dst over that interface via ARP
        else
            if (dst network num in my forwarding table) then
                deliver packet to NextHop router
            else
            deliver to default router
        ```
    
- Address Translation via ARP 
    In the above algorithm, suppose the dst host is in the same physical network as the router, how to send it to the dst host? Issue: IP datagram contains destination **IP address**, but the link-layer protocol only understands the addressing scheme of that particular physical network (e.g. a 48-bit Ethernet address). We need some way for this translation.
    
    **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** enables **each host** to build a table (called *ARP cache*) of mapping from IP addresses to link-level addresses. If a host wants to an IP packet to a host on the same physical network, if checks ARP cache for a mapping. If no mapping found, it broadcast the ARP query to the network. The query contains the target IP address. The receiver checks if it matches the IP address and sends a response message (via link-layer) containing its link-layer address back to the sender. The sender then adds the information to its ARP cache. 
    
    Note that the ARP query message also includes the IP address and MAC address of the sending host. Thus, when a host broadcasts a query message, each host on the network can learn the sender’s link-level and IP addresses and place that information in its ARP table. Refer to `hw2.md`. 


- classful IP address allocation
    ![](classesful-ip-addr.jpg)  
    Note that the network layer only cares about the network portion of an IP address. Again, the service of layer 3 is to move packet to the destination **network**, not destination host.  

    - Problems 
        The classful allocation is inherently inefficient and inflexible. Problems:  
        1. each physical network requires a unique network number and this quickly uses up the entire address space;
        2. Address space is not efficiently assigned due to the big gap betweent sizes of different classes. Many addresses in a class-B network could be wasted.  

- Solution to problem 1: subnetting  
    - Idea: Take a single IP network number, allocate IP addresses with that network number to multiple physical networks, referred to as *subnets*.   
    
    - Mechanism: a *subnet number* is computed by ANDing the subnet mask with the IP address.
    When router want to forward a packet to a certain IP address, it firstly compute the subnet number of the destination. If within the same subnet, send the packet direclty; otherwise, send the packet to a rounter to be forwarded to another subnet.  
    
    The forwarding table changes slightly with subnetting: Previously, forwarding table contains `<Network Num, Next Hop>` entries. With subnetting, the table holds `<Subnet number, Subnet mask, Next Hop>`. To find the right entry, the router ANDs the packet's dst IP address with the `Subnet mask` for each entry. If the result matches the `Subnet number`, it finds the match and forward the packet to the corresponding `Next Hop`.   
    
    The algorithm changes as follows:
    ```
    D = dst IP address
    for each entry (SubnetNum, SubnetMask, NextHop):
        D1 = SubnetMask & D
        if D1 == SubnetNum
            if NextHop is an interface
                deliver datagram to destination
            else
                deliver datagram to NextHop (a router)
    ```
    
    `NextHop` could be an interface or an router. If the router is connected with the subnet directly, `NextHop` would be an interface; otherwise, `NextHop` is another router.
    
- Consequence
  
    - Without subnetting, there's a one-one mapping between physical network and IP network number; With subnetting, different physical networks can have the same IP network number, but each with different subnet number. This saves some network numberes.
    - Subnetting also solves a problem. Consider a geographically large network. Up to now, the only way we know to deliver a packet within a network is to layer2 protocol. However, layer 2 networks have their geographical range restriction. So without subnetting, we really don't know how to deliver packet within a large network. Subnetting enables us using layer 3 protocol to deliver packets to each subnet. Then layer2 protocl is used to deliver packets to host only within the subnet, which hopefully is much smaller.
    
- Solution to problem 2: supernetting  
    Supernetting is also called *Classless Interdomain Routing*, or CIDR.  

    - Difference between subnetting and supernetting 
        Subnetting allows splitting a classful address among multile subnets, while CIDR allows coalescing several classful addresses into a single "supernet".  

    - Two conflicting requirement
        - minimizing routes a router needs to know 
        - assigning addresses efficiently.  

        Consider a company with 257 hosts in it, which just exceeds a class C network. If we assign a class B network to it, the efficiency is just 257/65536=0.4%. 
        
        Subnetting doesn't help here. Subnetting just means you can decide how routing works within your network domain, but doesn't allow you to assign network of size different from class A, B, C. So in this case, a class B network would be assigned.
        
        Another possibility is to give out a number of class C networks, instead of a class B network, unless the requirement is close to 64K. Problem: excessive storage in the forwarding table of the router. If a single site has 16 class C networks, every internet backbone router needs 16 entries in the routing table to direct packet to that site, even if the path is exactly the same for each of them. If we have used a class B entry, one table entry is sufficient.
        
        So we see the conflict between minimizing the number of routes stored in the router, and the need to assign addresses efficiently. 
        
    - Main idea: breaks the rigid boundaries between address classes. 
        CIDR assigns networks on powers of 2, i.e., networks can have a size of 2 ~ 2^31 hosts. In practice, the range is 2^8 ~ 2^24.
    
    - CIDR uses `/X` to represent network numbers, or *prefixes*. 
    
- Subnetting and supernetting summary

    - Subnetting works in networks of any size, no matter whether supernetting is used. Without subnetting, we would not be able to handle geographically large networks that exceed layer2 restrictions. With subnetting, we can use IP protocol to deliver the packet to the subnet, and then layer2 protocol can be used within the subnet.

    - Supernetting just allows us to assign networks of any size of power 2. Without it, we have to assign by class.
