- Abstract perspective of network
    - Node: devices that facilitate communication
    - Link: physical media that connect nodes (copper, fiber, air, etc).
    - Simplest network: a link connecting 2 devices
    - Multiple access network: more than 2 nodes communicate simultaneously using a **shared** link.  
    - circuit switching v.s. packet switching
        - circuit switching: dedicated path between nodes being set up before transmission.  
            Implication: there might not be sufficient resources to complete the circuit.
        - packet switching: data is sent in well-defined blocks(called packets) with headers that include a destination address. This is called destination-based forwarding.  
            The process is also called "store-and-forward". The node stores the received packet in its memory, and then forwards the packet to the next node.  

    - switch v.s. router
        - Switch: connecting nodes within a network
        - Router: connecting multiple networks
