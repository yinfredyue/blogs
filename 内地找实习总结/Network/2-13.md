- Framing: detecting where packets start and end
    - Sentinel method 
        Begin frame with a "synchronize" `SYN` character, followed by the header, then the payload, then characters that note the end of the frame.
        ![sentinel method](sentinel-method.jpg)
        Note: 
        - 2 `SYN`s for safety
        - `SOH`: start of header
        - `STX`/`ETX`: start/end of payload
        - `CRC`: cyclic redundancy check for error detection

    - Byte-counting 
        Use special `SYN` character to identify the start of a frame, then include the number of bytes in the frame. 
        If the byte count gets corrupted, framing fails.
    
    - Clock-based 
        Use special characters to identify start&end of frames, but only looks for start/end at specified time.

## Layer 2: Data Link Layer
Data link layer is concerned with data transfer between **adjacent** hosts in the same Local Area Network (LAN). In other words, all communications within the LAN take place at layer 2.

Challenge: coordinate hosts with access to the same channel so that hosts can communicate simultaneously.
